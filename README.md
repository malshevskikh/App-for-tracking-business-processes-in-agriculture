<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<h4>
Mobile application for tracking business processes in agriculture - a diploma project designed to eliminate risks that may arise during the business process, namely: data leakage or inconsistency, violation of established standards for storing process objects, violation of business process deadlines, etc.
</h4>
<h4>
In this case, the blockchain is very well suited for this, because it is a distributed registry. Accordingly, information about the stages can be presented in the form of blocks that are included in the blockchain itself. The advantage is that each block is linked, this will help to ensure the correct sequence of process stages. The inability to change blocks in the chain allows you to avoid unauthorized data adjustments.
</h4>
<h4>
It is also convenient if at any time any employee can check the current state and draw some conclusions, instead of frequently contacting co-workers who compile and rewrite management accounting. Accordingly, there is a need for accessibility and efficiency of access to data. A mobile application is the closest solution to the identified problem, since almost every person has a smartphone.
